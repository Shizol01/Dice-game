# Dice-game
Dice game in the interpreter

"Dice game.py" was written by myself. I know it requires a proper type of input; otherwise, it won't work.

By googling and asking AI, I found solutions to these problems.

With "Dice game 2.py", the input validation issue was resolved at a level I understand. With AI assistance, the code was also made clearer.

With "Regex dice game", I learned that regex can be used in Python. Previously, I had only used regex generated online in games. This code helped me understand how regex works in Python and how to build my own regex patterns.

"Solution" is a copy of the code from my course. Based on previous solutions, I assumed that the correct approach is to split the game into multiple functions. This makes it easier to diagnose issues and improves readability. However, this solution was written in a single function using list comprehension. Since it works correctly, I concluded that the key is to break it down into logical blocks.

"Solution regex" incorporates answers I found through research and is structured as a single function with list comprehension. This course introduced me to regex for the first time.

I am analyzing the code and rewriting it myself to better understand and memorize it.
